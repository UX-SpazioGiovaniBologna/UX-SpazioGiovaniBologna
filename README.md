# UX-SpazioGiovaniBologna
<p> The report includes all the research, design and user tests carried out for the creation of an ancillary site about the ​Spazio Giovani Bologna.​ The website will be hosted on the site of Servizio Sanitario Regionale - Emilia Romagna Azienda Unità Sanitaria Bologna. We have chosen to deal with ​Spazio Giovani,​ a dedicated space inside the family counselling centre, reserved for young people from 14 to 19. The service is free access and offers an environment where young people can face problems related to sexuality, affective and relational life, as well as gynecological problems, contraception and prevention. The service is also aimed at adults of reference for young people: parents, teachers, educators and sports coaches.</p>
